# Eloquent javascript exercises

The link for the book from I get this excersies/challenges is [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).
It's a great book for learning javascript fundamentals not because it's so techy, it's more because it just a little techy (just enough) and if you have some xp with js the lecture became perfect <3.
